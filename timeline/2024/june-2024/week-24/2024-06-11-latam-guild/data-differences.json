Unlike the African Guild, which has core contributor members on its team, the members of the LATAM region are new to the program and the initiation in many cases is from scratch, that is why we reinforced the introduction to the program, the value proposition and developed the most relevant points to be able to address the candidate training strategy. Governance: We discussed the usefulness and use of ‘Chilli Pepper’ LATAM Guilds Token for the Guilds reputation system and self governance. Q3 Budget proposal update and situation status."
