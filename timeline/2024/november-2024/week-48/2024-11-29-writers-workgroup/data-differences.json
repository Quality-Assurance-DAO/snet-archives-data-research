      "gitbook": "Kick-off: The writers' workgroup's weekly meeting started about 15 minutes past 3 o’clock. Kenichi welcomed everyone as usual and highlighted the reason we couldn’t join the call earlier — the marketing guild call was still ongoing! \n\nExploring Web3 Publishing Platforms:  Momentarily, we delved into how we can move forward with our publications. Cjfrankie shared some of the research documents from the last two meetings. And we talked about how we can expand. Then Ines discussed getting some graphics for the recent article she wrote “The Consciousness Explosion,” which is around 19 minutes long. Kenichi added that he would edit the draft and schedule it for publication, while Gorga volunteered to make some graphics for the draft. \n\nBudget Cap: Before now, we had so many views for Q1 2025, however, there’s a limit to what we can do — we hope AGIX pumps. This led to Gorga asking about the Indonesian page he proposed in Q3 2024. Kenichi cleared the air by saying that we’re at the limit of our agreed 10,500 AGIX budget cap, so we have removed items on our Q1 2025 budget so that we don’t go over budget. He added that new initiatives might not be able to come in, including the Indonesian page. He also discussed the importance of getting a separate wallet to enable the WWG to swap the budget to stablecoin, and reward writers with AGIX instead of USD-based rewards. Nonetheless, he added that the page can be created now, but it will have little attention. \n\nTwitter Premium: Kenichi hinted that the writers' workgroup cannot get metrics from the Spanish page and the Pidgin page because we do not have any premium plans. He added that any page with 1,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter) will get a premium account, and the allocation for managing these pages will be different. \n\nMonthly Stats: As we say goodbye to November 2024, we reflected on our journey since the beginning of the quarter. We glanced through all the social media accounts (X, Substack, Medium) to see how they performed in November, and the numbers and stats were quite impressive. We also revisited our Q4 2024 report to see if there are any changes we can make. \n\nSingularityNET Ambassador community: Kenichi introduced the new SNET community launched on X. He hinted that the page is up and running, and he encouraged everyone to join the community including the social media managers, so he can make them moderators. From a bird’s-eye view, the community is built to unite, empower, and celebrate the SNET ambassador community by connecting and sharing knowledge. Lastly, he added that there should be more interaction on X by replying to questions from community members. As a matter of finality, Kenichi said that the points system rewards for November would go out next week on Tuesday, and he urged every writer to check the boxes.",
