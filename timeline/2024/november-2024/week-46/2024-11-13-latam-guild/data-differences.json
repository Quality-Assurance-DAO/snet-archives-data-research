Martín Rivero presented a document that includes a philosophical introduction and technical topics, while Inés will contribute her perspective on transhumanism and Dani will participate in the discussion. Guillermo suggested improvements in the structure of the content, and it was agreed that all participants can make comments until the event, highlighting collaboration and flexibility in planning. The importance of document translation was also discussed, with Daniela Alves confirming the sending of a translation into Portuguese and the need to humanize translations.",
