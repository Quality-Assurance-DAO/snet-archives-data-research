He also encouraged the Scribes to source more drafts. Kenichi added that he would dig into the inventory to source old, unpublished articles pending the time when new drafts will be ready! \n\nFrom a bird‚Äôs-eye view, July looks like a transformative month for the WWG: we crossed our KPI of 200 followers on the ambassador Medium page, but we're not stopping there! We need more people to engage with our content.\n\nPeer Review: Following a discussion with the Writers' WG test submission, Kenichi still emphasized the need for using suggestion mode to edit drafts so that the writers can see what changes were made. Kenichi also commended Nengi for her test;  momentarily, he announced that Nengi is now officially a Scribbler and that he will get the Scribbler tag for her. He also encouraged the Scribes to keep sharing the WWG Scribbler Onboarding Form since we haven't reached our onboarding number for Q3.\n\nFollowing the revamped marketing guild, marketing wants to join forces with the writers' workgroup. To this effect, Kenichi proposed a giveaway or airdrop initiative where people with the highest Zealy points get rewarded.",
